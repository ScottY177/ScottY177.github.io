# Project Description

We have built and trained several virtual agents performing various tasks in the virtual environment using deep reinforcement learning. By understanding the activation patterns of the agentâ€™s virtual brains, we can discover whether our agents have successfully learned higher-level abstractions of their current states and the environment. We also investigated how our agents learn to achieve certain tasks through various online and offline learning methods, such as soft-actor-critic and imitation learning. In summary, this senior capstone project investigates a new approach to learning about animal ethology that leverages computational powers and deep neural networks.
