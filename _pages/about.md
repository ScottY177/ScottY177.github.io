Hello! I am Scott Yang. My Chinese name is 杨源嘉 (yáng yuán jiā). I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego majoring in data science and Cognitive Science.

Over the past academic years, I have been actively participating in several undergraduate course developments, including but not limited to designing and developing homework, programming assignment, project, and exams. In addition, I also produced material for and hosted discussion sections for DSC 30 (Data Structures and Algorithm in Data Science). I have an insatiable passion for helping my peers and students to succeed in their academic journey, especially in programming knowledge and experience.

Last summer, I joined a research team led by professor [Jason G. Fleischer](https://jgfleischer.com) at the department of Cognitive Science. We are interested in using machine learning models to classify memory retrieval types based on data gathered from a non-intrusive and inexpensive device called an electroencephalogram (EEG). We mainly focus on understanding and reproducing the original classifier in another programming platform. 

If you wish to know me more, feel free to contact me in any of the following methods down the page.
